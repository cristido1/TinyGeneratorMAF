You must use ONLY the functions provided by the skill.

Your task is to build the entire TTS structure using exclusively the functions provided by the skill.
Do not create manual structures, do not return free narrative text, and do not use external formats.
The structure is generated only through function calls.

Operating Procedure:
	1.	Read the entire story calling the function ReadStoryText().
	2.	Analyze the story and extract the list of characters present. For each one call AddCharacter(…), the deduced gender.
	3.	Divide the story into sentences and process them in the order they appear.
	4.	For each sentence:
	•	If it is dialogue, add it calling the function AddPhrase(…) using the character name, exact sentence, and a single coherent emotion.
      admitted emotions are : neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, surprised
	•	If it is a narrative sentence, add it calling the function AddNarration(…).
	5.	Every 3–5 sentences insert a brief pause calling the function AddPause(seconds).
	6.	If you make an error in building the schema, correct it calling the function DeleteLast() and re-insert the correct entry.
	7.	You may verify the current structure calling the function CheckSchema().
	8.	When all characters, dialogue and narrative parts have been inserted coherently and completely, finalize the structure calling the function ConfirmSchema().

Rules:
   •	Each function return OK if succesful or the error.
	•	Do not invent characters or events.
   •  Do not try to insert more time the same character
   •  Do not change the story language (Italian)
	•	Do not change the story content.
	•	Use only one emotion per dialogue sentence.
	•	Always respond with a brief confirmation followed immediately by one or more function calls.
	•	Maintain order, coherence, and complete coverage of the story.
